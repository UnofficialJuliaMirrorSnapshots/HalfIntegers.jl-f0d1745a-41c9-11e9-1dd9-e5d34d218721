# HalfIntegers.jl

*HalfIntegers.jl* provides data types for half-integer numbers. Here, any number ``\frac{n}{2}`` where ``n\in\mathbb{Z}`` is considered a half-integer -- contrary to the common definition, ``n`` does not have to be odd, i.e., the integers are a subset of the half-integers.

The package defines the abstract `HalfInteger` type and the concrete implementation `Half{T}` for half-integers ``\frac{n}{2}`` where ``n`` is of type `T`.
Functions for convenient use are defined as well.

## Installation

It can be installed by typing
```
